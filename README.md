# Stock_Price-_Prediction_Traditional_Models_and_LSTM
This project aims to predict the direction of Apple's stock price (AAPL) using traditional machine learning models and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The goal is to determine whether the closing price will increase or decrease the next day based on historical stock data.

### Introduction
Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the market's volatile nature. This project implements a comparative analysis of traditional machine learning models and an LSTM neural network to forecast the daily directional movement of Apple's stock price.

### Project Overview
- Objective: Predict whether the closing price of AAPL will increase or decrease the next day.
- Features: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.
- Target: Binary classification - 1 (price increase), 0 (price decrease).

### Data: 
The dataset downloaded from Kaggle that contains five years of historical stock price data for various companies.

### Models Used: 
Traditional Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and Deep Learning: LSTM Neural Network
